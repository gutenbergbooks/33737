  <p>The Text here presents you with a <i>strange woman</i>; with whom
  though I desire not to procure you a <i>familiar acquaintance</i>, yet
  I'le give you such cognizance of her, and excite that abhorrency of her
  baseness in all your minds, that if any have heretofore been sick for
  want of her company, he shall now be as sick of it; after I have made it
  appear that this <a name="NtA1" href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>beautiful
  Siren, having a Womans face, ends in the Serpents tail; and discovered,
  not onely the <i>Virgins-face</i> of this unsatiable <i>Harpye</i>, but
  her cruel talons also shrowded under her wings. That you may therefore
  (as<a name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Amnon</i> <!-- Page 2
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>did upon
  <i>Tamar</i>) bolt the door upon this <i>strange woman</i>, and no longer
  endure the <i>whoredoms</i> of this painted <i>Jezebel</i>; I'le
  endeavour to characterize her to you, and by the infallible clue of Truth
  conduct you through all her intricate and winding Labyrinths. Be pleased
  therefore, for the explication of the word [<i>Strange</i>] to take
  notice, that this Epithite was by the <i>Græcians</i> attributed to their
  common Prostitutes, which they called <span title="xenas" class="grk"
  >&xi;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>strangers</i>: And hence, I
  conceive, it was that the Com&oelig;dian called <a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><i>Glycerium</i> who was thought to live by
  the unlawful submission of her body, <i>Peregrinam</i>, a stranger, a
  strange woman. But I have onely hitherto told you her name; I shall now
  therefore proceed further to describe her to you by her sordid actions,
  which will ascertain you of those miseries which are her constant
  waiting-women or attendants. That I may therefore speedily prosecute my
  design, She is one whom not <i>Argus</i>'s hundred eyes, nor
  <i>brazen</i> walls, nor the most vigilant Guards can secure from her
  lascivious incontinency: the bars and <a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>hedges which Nature has made for her <!--
  Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>tongues
  confinement are not sufficient to restrain it within the limits of a
  modest discourse; and should we lock up her impure lips with a command of
  silence, yet could we never limit the infiniteness of her lascivious
  thoughts, with which she would as freely commit fornication, as if she
  were at liberty, and in the enjoyment of the greatest voluptuary; and we
  may say of her what <i>Scipio</i> in another case said of himself, <a
  name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a><i>She is never less alone than
  when alone</i>. She tricks her self up with such variety of gauderies as
  if she were to expose her body to bring the Devil to her lure, and
  <i>tempt the Tempter himself</i> to love her; and were that opinion of
  <i>Tertullian</i> true, That the <i>Devils</i> and <i>fallen Angels</i>
  had carnal commerce with the <i>Daughters of Men</i>, and they should
  desire one to satisfie their lustful appetite, I'de recommend the strange
  woman in the Text unto them; who (like <i>Circe</i>) is an amiable
  Sorceress, and when she hath <i>once</i> charmed her <i>Gallant</i> with
  youthful blood sparkling in his veins, and beauty dancing in his face,
  into the endless Circle of her lust, hee'l find a difficult <a
  name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>recovery. <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span><a name="NtA7"
  href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>Physitians tell us, that the reason we have
  in Feverish distempers our <i>Paroxysme</i> but every second, third, or
  fourth day, and not at every circulation of the blood about the body, is,
  because the blood when it arrives to the heart must acquire such a degree
  of corruption before it can effect it, and therefore because this
  corruption is not sensible before many circulations have been performed,
  it cannot so soon create a <i>Paroxysme</i>: But in this impure and
  libidinous strumpets heart 'tis far otherwise; for she endures the
  Paroxysmes of the <i>Fever</i> of <i>Lust</i> every hour and moment, and
  the <i>circulation</i> of her lusts in her heart is sooner performed then
  that of her blood. <i>Medea</i> had not more damnable Arts to preserve
  youth and beauty then she, who has perfectly attain'd the Art of making
  new beauty, new hair, and counterfeit teeth; and not thinking she hath
  charms enough to render her amiable, has recourse to the Merchants, as
  unto Natural Magick, to buy there what Nature would not give her, and to
  make her self liked in spight of Nature's disfavours; and being
  accustomed to <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>varnish over her decayed Cheeks, and the
  ruines of a good Face, with the fresh colours of an adventicious Paint,
  she by her licentiousness seems to usurp the power and liberty of
  Painters, who (according to the Poet) <a name="NtA8"
  href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>were priviledg'd to do what they pleased;
  and (to say truth) she is an exact Painter in all her actions; for the
  varnishes over the deformed and execrable Name of <i>Whore</i>, with the
  flourishing <i>Title</i> and <i>Colour</i> of a <i>Lady of pleasure</i>:
  and whilest she discourses to her Gallant of the unlawful use of her
  body, she colours it over with the title of a great and incomparable
  favour; and (<i>Mahomet</i>-like) perswades all her <i>adorers</i>, that
  there's no <i>Paradise</i> but that of carnal fruition, and the
  gratification to a <i>domineering Lust</i>: But I fear that this
  <i>Paradise</i> she puts them in will prove but a <i>Fools Paradise</i>;
  for I believe they'l quickly conclude, That the sulphureous flames which
  <i>Ætna's</i> fiery paunch continually vomits into the Air bear not so
  forcible and durable a heat as the Calentures of her lustful blood; and
  that the poyson'd garment dipt in the <i>Centaur's</i> blood, which
  caused <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span><i>Hercules</i> to burn in living flames, had
  had not such vigour and vehemency as her enflamed Lust. Whilest I hear
  one Historian talk of <i>Sempronia</i>, and give her this character, <a
  name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><i>That she oftner courted men
  to her embraces then she was courted by them</i>, I fancy he makes
  mention of the strange woman in the Text: and whilest I hear another
  report, that <i>Julia</i> arrived to that heighth of licentiousness, <a
  name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a><i>That she would leave
  nothing undone which she could basely commit, either by Action or
  Passion, judging that lawful which pleased her humour best</i>, me thinks
  he characterizes our strange woman to us. King <i>Solomon</i>
  (understanding a hot Prostitute) tells us, <i>Prov.</i> 6. 27. a man
  cannot take fire into his bosom, but he must be necessarily burnt; and I
  believe that many of the Gallants of our time, who have thought onely to
  <i>warm</i> and cherish their lusts at this she-fire, have at last been
  soundly <i>burnt</i> by taking her into their bosomes: for this strange
  Woman is not like the <i>Glow-worm</i>, that carries only a counterfeit
  <i>heat</i>, nor of so cold a constitution as the <i>Moon</i> was when
  she embraced <i>Endymion</i>; but he that <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>embraces her shall find the
  same entertainment the Satyr did, that kiss'd the fiery coal and burnt
  his lips; and we may say of her, what the tyrant <i>Nero</i> once said of
  himself and his mother <i>Agrippina</i>, "<a name="NtA11"
  href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>That there can nothing come of her into
  the world but what is detestable and accursed." This <i>Helena</i> is hot
  enough to <i>inflame</i> Troy; this <i>Hecuba</i> can bring forth nothing
  but a Fire-brand. Though the Toad hath a precious Stone in her head, yet
  her body is poysonous: And so, though this Strange Woman may wear a
  handsome countenance, and for her superficial and skin-deep beauty seem
  an inestimable Jewel, yet, if we view her throughly, we shall discover
  the venom of her impure body; for, though <i>her lips drop as an honey
  comb, and her mouth is smoother then oyl, yet her end is bitter as
  wormwood, and sharp as a two-edg'd sword</i>. Upon which two Verses of
  the Text, as upon two pillars, I build this practical Proposition,</p>

<p><!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>That the short and transitory pleasures which the strange woman
  affords us, are accompanied with the sharpest and most permanent
  evils.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And that, First, Because she'l wound and stain our reputation. How
  full is the adulterer of fears and jealousies, scorching desires, and
  impatient waitings, tedious demurrs, sufferance of indignities, and
  amazements of discoveries, and his uncleanness is ever attended by shame
  which is its eldest daughter; for let us consider how infamous it has
  ever been, to be noted for a common <i>Pathick</i>, or a lustful
  <i>Amoretto</i>, how opprobriously Adulterers have been used by most
  Nations. The Law of the <i>Ægyptians</i> was to cut off the Nose of an
  Adulterer; the <i>Locrians</i> put out the Adulterers Eyes; and (the more
  notoriously to intimate his effeminacy) others cloathed him with wool;
  and <i>Solons</i> Law was this, <i>If any man take an Adulterer in the
  fact, he may use him how he pleases</i>: And in the Twelve Tables, <a
  name="NtA12" href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>If you <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>take a man in the act of
  Adultery, you may kill him without danger of punishment; Impunity was
  intailed upon the murther of him. You may observe, that this sin of
  Adultery is in Scripture called a <i>sin of darkness</i>; intimating to
  us, how the Adulterer, asham'd of the light, sneaks up and down in
  obscure recesses, and is onely active and vigilant when others are quiet
  and taking their repose. Other sinners iniquities are in Scripture
  numbred by the hairs of the head; but we cannot number the Adulterers so,
  because <i>as his sins increase his hairs do fall</i>; the <i>Spring</i>
  of his sins is his hairs <i>Fall o' th' leaf</i>. The second account upon
  which the Adulterer will conclude, That the transitory pleasures which
  the strange woman affords us are accompanied with the sharpest evils,
  is,</p>

  <p>2. Because hee'l finde she will impair the health of his body; for
  though her Lips drop as an Honey-comb, and she distil the Quintessence of
  Rhetorick in every expression; though she does amorously caress and
  embrace him, yet 'tis but as the encircling Ivie does the Oak, to make
  him rot, wither, and decay. <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>Though he may think himself in Heaven, and
  imagine her <i>curled Arms</i> about him to be his <i>Celestial
  Zodiack</i>, yet hee'l (at length) finde them but as chains and fetters
  to enslave and captivate him to her insatiable Lust; the gratifications
  whereof whilest he endeavours to shew her, he must undergo as many
  <i>gripes</i> in his guilty Conscience, as <i>Aches</i> in his impure and
  vitious Body. She, it may be, will foment and cherish the flames of his
  Lust with these pleasing Blasts, by telling him that the Virgin
  <i>Spring</i> does not appear less chaste because many thirsts are there
  quenched; and that those Waters stink soon that continue long in one
  place, but remain sweet and wholsome whilest they leave one bank and kiss
  another. But let us (like a prudent <i>Ulysses</i>) stop our ears to the
  fatal voice of this dangerous <i>Siren</i>, least, while we sail in the
  <i>Ocean</i> of this World, we suffer <i>shipwrack</i> of Grace and a
  good Conscience: Don't let us stand to dispute the case, and parley with
  her, but rather flie from her, and avoid her company: For, we must be
  extremely cold, not to be warmed by so <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>fair a fire, and very
  strong, to make defence against so charming an Enemy. Nor can we touch
  Pitch with our hands, but a foul impress will be received from it: One
  rotten kernel of the Pomgranate infects the fellows; and St. <i>Paul</i>
  made that Verse Canonical, <i>Evil communication corrupts good
  manners</i>. And it is noted of <i>Joseph</i>, that as soon as his
  Mistress had laid her impure hands upon his garment, he leaves it behinde
  him, that he might be sure to avoid the danger of her contagious touch.
  And we shall assuredly finde, that she who but now compared her self to a
  <i>pleasant Spring</i>, will at last serve us with the <i>bitter
  Waters</i> of <i>Marah</i>. For I appeal to the common Adulterer, Whether
  he be not <i>a walking Hospital</i> and <i>Pest-house</i> of
  <i>Diseases</i>? Whether he is not alwayes possest with a <span
  title="Peirazôn" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&alpha;&zeta;&omega;&nu;</span>, a Devil that
  first tempts him to all Uncleanness, and afterwards terrifies and
  exanimates him with the greatest horrour imaginable? and whether the
  violent and fervent heat of his lustfull appetite be not as unquenchable
  as Hell-flames? Could we have <i>Lynceus</i> his eyes, and look through
  <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>the
  decayed walls of his Body, what rottenness should we discover in his
  exhausted Bones? how would the whole Fabrick of his Body appear invalid
  and unnerved, and represent it self to us as the Embleme of a Sack of dry
  Bones, whose every part, were it anatomized and opened, it would corrupt
  and infect the Air, and store the World with as many Diseases as the
  opening of <i>Pandora's</i> Box: insomuch that he who shall be besotted
  with so Lethargick a stupidity as to harbour and caress this <i>strange
  woman</i>, He (like the <i>Hyrcanians</i>) may be said to keep a Dog to
  devour himself, or (like the mad <i>Romans</i> in <i>Arrian</i>) court
  the Fever of his own Lust, that will soon consume him, and render him as
  meager and pellucid as the meerest Skeleton; causing withal a no less
  decay in his Estate then in his Body; and this I conceive induced
  <i>Solomon</i> to say, <a name="NtA13"
  href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a><i>That by means of a whorish woman a man
  is brought to a piece of bread, and the adulteress will hunt for the
  precious life</i>. But if this be not sufficient to deter the Adulterer
  from this Prostitutes company, I'le advance a step higher, and press <!--
  Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>him with
  a third Argument, to prove, That those transitory pleasures the strange
  Woman affords us are accompanied with the sharpest and most permanent
  evils: and that</p>

  <p>3. Because by her means an irreparable and irrecoverable damage will
  accrue to his immortal Soul. And in this St. <i>Paul</i> shall be my
  President, who <a name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>bids us
  not be deceived, assuring us, <i>That neither fornicators, nor
  adulterers, nor effeminate persons, shall enter into the Kingdome of
  God</i>. <a name="NtA15" href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>It was not
  permitted to a Dog to enter into the <i>Acropolis</i>, because of his
  excessive heat in Venery; and so neither will it be permitted to those
  that (like the Dog) indulge themselves in the excessive heat of Venery,
  to enter into <i>Heaven</i>, which may for its heighth be called an
  <i>Acropolis</i>, which (being interpreted) is, a City built upon a Hill.
  Let us consider how impossible it is that our Prayers and Oblations
  should be acceptable to God, when they are offered with impure hands,
  reeking in lust: How can we expect to look God in the face (whose eyes
  are purer then to behold iniquity) with our impure <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>eyes? How can we hope to
  be Eagle-ey'd enough to look up to God, whose eyes are ten thousand times
  brighter then the Sun, when we have so weakned our eyes by the <i>Works
  of Darkness</i>, that (like Night-birds) we dread to behold the Light?
  How should <i>Chamberings</i> and <i>Wantonness</i> hope to get room in
  Heaven, whence all kind of Marriage is excluded? When the two opposite
  Poles of the World meet together, and two Contradictions at the same time
  prove true, then, and not till then, will I believe that the Fornicator
  and Heaven can kiss each other. How can we call God <i>Father</i>, who
  utterly renounces those spurious off-springs of our sinful lusts, which
  have not their Original, nor derive their Pedegree from God, but the
  World and our depraved Natures? Which S. <i>John</i><a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> intimates to us; who making an Inventory
  of the <i>Goods</i>, or rather of the <i>Evils</i> of this World, besides
  <i>the Lust of the Eye</i>, and <i>the Pride of Life</i>, he tells us,
  that the <i>Lust of the Flesh is not of God</i>, but of the
  <i>World</i>.</p>

  <p>It remains now that I should prescribe you some few <i>Recipe's</i>
  and Antidotes; <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>which if you'l make use of, I'le warrant to
  cure you of the Fever of Lust, into which the <i>Strange Woman</i> will
  endeavour to cast you: And my first is this.</p>

  <p>First then, Let every one make a Covenant with his eyes, never to look
  upon any object with a lustfull and impure inclination. <i>Job</i> 31. 1.
  <i>I have made a Covenant with my eyes, why then should I look upon a
  maid?</i> Shut your Eyes, those <i>Windows</i> of your Soul, through
  which you receive the <i>Species</i> from all sinful Objects; for,
  through those <i>windows</i> a little sin (like a little Boy) may creep
  in, and open the Door of your Heart to the rest. An eminent Historian of
  our own Nation tells us, That whilest the Earl of <i>Salisbury</i> was at
  the Battel of <i>Orleance</i>, opening a little window of the Castle,
  where he was to view the Enemy, a little Lad killed him with a Cannon
  planted and discharg'd against the Windows. So, it may be, whilest thou
  openest thy Souls windows, thy Eyes, to look upon a beautiful Object, a
  small Lust may chance to shoot thee with a temptation, and leave thee
  <i>dead in sin</i> for ever. <i>Scipio</i> and <i>Alexander</i> both of
  them are <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>reported to have taken fair Captives:
  <i>Scipio</i> would not suffer his to come into his sight, lest he
  himself might be captivated by their beauty; but <i>Alexander</i> gave
  his Captives admittance into his presence: And though <i>Alexanders</i>
  was the greater continency, yet <i>Scipio</i> took the wisest course;
  for, <a name="NtA17" href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a><i>'Tis dangerous to
  look upon that by which we may at length be ensnared; the exposing of
  Beauty to be seen, and the loss of Modesty and Chastity follow one
  another</i>. Let us therefore attend to our blessed Saviours words, who
  tells us, <a name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>That
  <i>whosoever looks upon a woman</i> with an intention <i>to lust after
  her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart</i>. When we
  come into the presence of <i>moving Beauties</i>, we must do as men
  usually do when the <i>Summer Sun</i> grows potent and vehement; though
  we admire their Beauties greatness, yet we must shun it's heat; each
  place can afford us a shadow to hide us from it. The Poets tell us, that
  when some young men had beheld the three equal beauty'd <i>Gorgones</i>,
  they were thereby deprived and divested of their human shape, and
  metamorphosed into stones: <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>So, if we be not cautious how we too
  lasciviously gaze upon powerful Beauties, who knows how soon we may be so
  callous and obdurate, and our hearts be rendred so stony, that without
  the least regret or remorse we may first fall into the profound Abyss of
  Adultery, and thence to that bottomless one of Hell. We must not do by a
  beautiful Object as by the Crocodile, but quite contrary; for we must be
  sure <i>not to look first upon it</i>, and then we shall remain secure
  from its <i>killing glances</i>: for, he who is still looking, and always
  gazing, acts like him who drinks Wine in the very heighth of a Fever. But
  if still men will look upon fair Objects, let the same use be made of
  them which the wiser sort of Catholicks do of Pictures; let their
  beautiful features serve to raise our Devotion to God, and make us admire
  his curious workmanship. And since Women are of late grown so proud and
  licentious as to expose and prostitute themselves to the eyes of men in
  unseemly and immodest gestures, and they onely shew themselves true
  <i>Britains</i> in this, that, like the ancient <i>Britains</i>, they
  delight to paint <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>their bodies, and (like the Rain-bow)
  display their transient and fading colours; let us, when we see such as
  these, call to mind these Considerations to allay those inordinacies
  which may otherwise arise in our thoughts from the contemplation of so
  vicious objects. Let us consider, That they are but vain Dames, to bestow
  such curious cost on so woful and sordid a piece of dirt, which (it may
  be) would otherwise resemble the clay <i>Prometheus</i> us'd before it
  was inform'd and animated; That 'tis their folly to guild a clay Wall,
  and enamel a <i>Bubble</i>, when they can give no other then a
  <i>Womans</i> Reason for it. Let us consider, That Women have no beauty
  but what we are pleased to give them; and that if we call them fair, 'tis
  but in the way of Poetry or Complement: And that these dim
  <i>Cynthia's</i> would be very obscure, if they borrowed not that light
  they have from the Sun of mens favour. Or suppose we are so candid and
  ingenuous as to grant them beautiful, yet we may see by experience, that
  their Beauty is like a sweet and much coveted Banquet, which is no sooner
  tasted but its delicious Luxury is <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>swallowed up by Oblivion.
  Let us think with our selves, That there's no conformation of lineaments,
  no composition of features, no symmetry of parts so exactly combin'd and
  compacted in one person, but a critical eye may discover some
  imperfection: fairest <i>Cynthia</i> is not without her spots, nor
  beautiful <i>Venus</i> without her moles.</p>

  <p>2. If you would be cured of the Fever of Lust, into which the
  <i>Strange Woman</i> will endeavour to cast you, use a moderate, slender
  and ascetick Diet. Be content with that with which Nature her self wil be
  contented, and then <a name="NtA19" href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>a
  little will suffice you; and if you do this, <a name="NtA20"
  href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>you will act according to the Rules of
  Discretion and Prudence. Use Fasting and severe Abstinence, which are the
  proper Abscissions of the instruments and temptations of lust. And to
  this is reducible a restraint from all morose delectation, and looser
  banquetting: You must not desire to be fed at <i>Vitellius</i> his board;
  you must not desire <i>Nero's</i> effeminate baths, nor <i>Tiberius</i>
  his naked Pictures to incite your lust; you must not hunt all grounds,
  draw all seas, search every <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>brook and bush, or dispeople the four
  Elements to please your wanton lusts, and try experiments upon your
  judicious palates; but as you must abstain from <a name="NtA21"
  href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>things <i>unlawful</i>, so also from
  <i>lawful</i> too: You must not onely take care you transcend not the
  <i>Bounds</i> of <i>Temperance and Moderation</i>, but you must sometimes
  abridge your selves of your necessary repast; assuring your selves,
  <i>That the more </i><a name="NtA22"
  href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a><i>you deny your selves, the more you
  shall receive from God</i>. 'Tis storied of <i>Richard Nevil</i> Earl of
  <i>Warwick</i>, (stiled also <i>Make-King</i>,) that in the great Battel
  at <i>Ferrybrigg</i> between <i>Henry</i> the Sixth and <i>Edward</i> the
  Fourth, when he perceived his side almost worsted by <i>Henry</i> the
  Sixth, he slew his Horse with his own Sword, and then uttered these
  Heroick expressions, <i>Let all that will fight stay with me</i>; and
  then (according to the Ceremony of those times) kissing the Cross upon
  his Sword, he fought with singular courage and prowess: So in the
  conflict between our Lusts and us, let us kill and mortifie our Bodies,
  which (in the language of <i>Socrates</i>) are our Soul's Horses, and
  then excite every Faculty <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>of our Souls with these words, <i>Let all
  that will fight stay with me</i>; and when we have done thus, let us kiss
  and take up our Cross, and fight stoutly under Christ the Captain of our
  Salvation against our Lusts; it being impossible to keep the Spirit pure,
  whilest 'tis overburdened with too much Flesh, and exposed to all
  entertainments of Enemies by fomentations and pamperings; remembring the
  divine counsel of the <a name="NtA23"
  href="#Nt23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>Philosopher, <i>That we must not take
  care for the Body simply as the Body, but as subservient to the Soul.</i>
  And that you may be the better induced to do this, remember (as the
  fore-cited Author <a name="NtA24" href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>has
  well said), <i>That your Soul is your self, but your Body yours; for 'tis
  the Soul which uses, but that which is used by it is the Body</i>: And by
  this separation of the Soul from the Body, you will preserve your nature
  from confusion, nor think that things <span title="ta entos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F70; &epsilon;&nu;&tau;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span> which are
  without concern you, nor contend for those as for your self, and so
  consequently avoid too much care of your body; not resembling those,
  that, so that Sumpter-horse the Body be hung with gaudy Trappings, and
  pamper'd, <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>care not with what rags they cloath the
  Soul. We may also consider that these high pamperings and feasting our
  selves have no real pleasure in them; and this I am sure was the Orators
  judgment, when he said, <a name="NtA25"
  href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a><i>I would not fancy or imagine with my
  self as if luxurious gluttons lived pleasantly, and such who vomit upon
  the table again what but now they took off, and with their crude
  stomacks, carried from Feasts, the next day ingurgitate themselves into
  them again; who, by reason of their laziness and surfeiting, see the Sun
  neither rise nor set, and are in indigency of those Estates which they
  have profusely expended: none of us</i> (saith he) <i>ever thought such
  gluttons as these live a pleasant life</i>. And the same Author tells us,
  <a name="NtA26" href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>That there is no less
  pleasure to be taken in a slender and spare diet, then in the most
  exquisite dainties; there being no less delight in the <i>Persian
  Nasturtium</i>, then in the richly furnished <i>Syracusan</i> Tables, so
  much cry'd down and <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span>discommended by <i>Plato</i>. But this shall
  suffice for the second <i>Recipe</i>: and my third is this.</p>

  <p>3. Secure your Heart so well that no ill thought creeps into it, and
  proves an incentive to lust; let not the smallest ventricle of your heart
  conceive an evil thought, lest at last it bring forth sin. One little
  Flie will taint and corrupt a great quantity of flesh; and so one little
  thought hovering about thy heart (like a little Flie) will quickly taint
  it. Be sure therefore (like the Emperour <i>Domitian</i><a name="NtA27"
  href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>) alwayes to be catching and killing
  these Flies. Consider, that if you indulge your selves in wicked thoughts
  and lustings, there wants nothing to the consummation of the act but some
  convenient circumstances, which because they are not then attainable, the
  act is for a time impeded, but the malice nothing abated: For <a
  name="NtA28" href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>the Law of <i>Not
  coveting</i> no less forbids sinful desires and concupiscences then
  sinful actions; for no man desires or lusts after any thing <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>but what pleases
  him: But every complacency or delight in an unlawful matter, although
  short and transient, nay, although at last repulsed and cohibited from
  breaking out into an external act, hath contracted by that very motion
  the blemish and spot of an internal sin. And hence S. <i>Augustin</i>,
  following the Doctrine of S. <i>Paul</i>, affirms, <a name="NtA29"
  href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>That the <i>concupiscence of the
  flesh</i> is sin in a good man, <i>Because he has in him a disobedience
  and reluctancy against the government of the rational faculty</i>. Again,
  He sins that inwardly lusteth or desires, although he follow not those
  desires by a consequent act, Because such motions are not pure passions,
  but involve negations of due acts which ought to have been in lieu
  thereof: A man may be incestuous <a name="NtA30"
  href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>that never bodily commits the act; and
  from these impure fires, which men kindle and cherish within them, they
  are usually in love with their deformed lusts, as <i>Alcæus</i> was with
  the warts <a name="NtA31" href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>in his Boys
  face, though they are deformed marks. When <i>Brutus</i> and
  <i>Cassius</i> assaulted <i>Cæsar</i> with a design and resolution to
  murther him, we read, that as soon as he saw <i>Brutus</i> he cryed <!--
  Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span>out,
  <span title="Kai su teknon" class="grk">&Kappa;&alpha;&iota;
  &sigma;&upsilon; &tau;&epsilon;&kappa;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</span>; <i>And
  art thou here my Son, my Darling</i>? and opened his breast to him. So
  when any Lust comes to assault us with a design to make us dead in sin,
  we court and caress it in <i>Cæsars</i> words, Art thou here, my Darling?
  and open our hearts and breasts unto it; whereas we should alwayes be
  prepared with preservatories against it.</p>

  <p>4. Let your discourse be alwayes chast and pure: Decline with great
  care all undecent obscenity in your language, chastening and confining
  your tongue, and restraining it with Grace; for, as St. <i>James</i>
  tells us, <i>Jam</i>. 3. 2. <i>If any man offend not in word</i> (tongue)
  <i>the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</i>
  Either be silent, or speak those things which are better then silence, is
  a good Rule here. Every bad tree is known by its bad fruit, and an
  unclean man may be trac'd by his unclean discourse; it being a shrewd
  symptom the Will is depraved, when our Discourse is unchaste and obscene.
  And in this <a name="NtA32"
  href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a><i>Hierocles</i> concurrs with me; <i>The
  Will of man</i> <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>(saith he) <i>adhering long neither to
  Virtue nor Vice, utters forth expressions inclining to both, as
  resembling the contrary affections in it</i>. This advice therefore of
  <i>Tyrius Maximus</i> is very soveraign; <a name="NtA33"
  href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a><i>I require such a pleasure in words
  which Virtue may not disdain to make her Waiting-woman and attend upon
  her.</i> St. <i>James</i> calls the Tongue a <i>fire</i>, Jam. 3. 6. And
  the School-men call the Lusts of the Flesh (<i>Fomes</i>) Tinder. Let us
  therefore be careful that the Fire of our Tongue light not upon this
  Tinder, and kindle it. Modesty and a becoming Blush is the <i>Fence</i>
  of all Virtue; and when this is broken down by obscene talk, the
  <i>Banks</i> will overflow with impure <i>Streams</i>. A Rose, when it
  hath lost its blush, and begins to look pale, by those symptoms you may
  conclude that 'tis a dying. It hath ever been accounted a true Rule,
  <i>Qualis Vir, talis Oratio</i>. We know the Bird by the Tune, the Beagle
  by his Mouth, and a Man by his Words. We cannot expect that he that hath
  lost his <i>voice</i> with his <i>Chastity</i> should sing Praises to God
  so <i>melodiously</i> as another that is chaste, virtuous, and continent.
  A <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>stinking breath is not a more sure symptom
  of <i>putrid Lungs</i>, then an obscene Tongue of an <i>unclean
  Heart</i>. 'Twere better that this <i>Clapper</i> stood still, except it
  could give a <i>purer sound</i>; it were better this <i>Clock</i> never
  struck, except it were for other ends then to awaken our Lusts, and put
  them in motion. And I look upon obscene discourse but as an <i>impure
  Breath</i> coming out of the mouth, which is fit for nothing but to make
  an <i>Exhalation</i> or <i>Ignis fatuus</i>, which (if we follow it) will
  lead us into Bogs and precipices of <i>Uncleanness</i>; but if we <i>fall
  down</i>, and prostrate our selves before God in <i>Prayer</i>, it will
  quickly be dissolved: Wherefore,</p>

  <p>5. Let us use frequent and earnest Prayers to God, to give us the
  assistance of his holy Spirit; for this Devil of Lust sometimes cannot be
  cast out but by Prayer. When the <i>Romans</i> were in great distress,
  &amp; surprized with a sudden assault of their Enemies, they ran to the
  Temple to get Arms, which were laid there against an extraordinary
  occasion: So, if we shall be at any time assaulted by our Lusts let us
  have recourse to the <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>Temple of God, and take up the Arms of the
  Church, which are Prayers and Tears. We must not (as <i>Nero</i> did at
  the burning of <i>Rome</i>) sing <i>Pæans</i> and rejoyce, when our
  Bodies (those Temples of the Holy Ghost) are burning with the flames of
  Lust. <i>Numa Pompilius</i>, when news was brought him that his Enemies
  were ready to surprize him, put off the Messenger with this ready
  memorable Speech, <span title="Egô de thuô" class="grk"
  >&Epsilon;&gamma;&omega; &delta;&epsilon; &theta;&upsilon;&omega;</span>,
  <i>I am offering a sacrifice to God</i>: So, when we have any news of
  being surprized by our Lusts, we may <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads `rerurn'.">return</span> the same answer; 'Tis
  enough if we are at our Prayers, which will secure and guard us from
  them. <i>Plutarch</i> reports of a Boy, who though he was burnt with a
  coal that fell from the Altar, yet continued his oblation of Sacrifice
  without intermission: So let us (though we are sometimes burned with the
  fire of Lust) be so fervent in our Prayers to God, that the
  <i>fervency</i> of them may exceed and draw away the heat of our Lusts,
  as a great Fire does the heat which was caused by a less.</p>

  <p>6. Avoid Idleness, and be sure alwayes to be well employed. I may give
  an idle <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>man that character one <a name="NtA34"
  href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>gives of <i>Themistocles</i> when out of
  imployment, <i>That he will be luxurious, dissolute, lustful, and
  intemperate</i>. Mans heart is a Mill ever grinding some grist or other;
  and I may add, If there be no grain for it to work upon, it sets itself
  on fire with lust. Let us consider, that whilest we are idle, and not
  imployed, we can expect no assistance from God, if we should be assaulted
  by Lust: according to that of the Historian: <a name="NtA35"
  href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a><i>When we once give our selves over to
  idleness, we shall in vain implore the aid and assistance of God, for
  then he is angry and offended at us</i>. No, no, let us rather be in
  continual action and imployment, and be diligently conversant in our
  several lawful vocations: For (as the same Author tells us) <a
  name="NtA36" href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a><i>We cannot by a few weak
  prayers only and faint Supplications obtain aid and assistance from God;
  but by watching, and being in continual action and consultation, all
  things will succeed prosperously unto us</i>. It was a saying <!-- Page
  30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>of <i>Appius
  Clodius</i>, <a name="NtA37" href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a><i>That it
  were better for the </i>Romans<i> to be busied and imployed, then remiss
  and idle; Because great Empires by agitation and motion are excited to
  Vertue</i>. And it was anothers complaint, <a name="NtA38"
  href="#Nt38"><sup>[38]</sup></a><i>That Idleness </i>(<i>that great enemy
  to Discipline</i>)<i> corrupted and spoiled the </i>Roman<i>
  Souldiers</i>. And so may we complain, that Idleness hinders us in our
  Spiritual Warfare against our Lusts. Whilest <i>Atalanta</i> was imployed
  in hunting with <i>Diana</i>, she kept her Virginity pure and immaculate;
  but when she fell into Idleness, she indulg'd her self in the
  gratification of her insatiable Lusts: So, whilest our Souls are employed
  in hunting after knowledge, and other things which are commendable and
  praise-worthy, they may preserve themselves from Lust and Uncleanness. It
  was a saying of a <i>Latine</i> Poet, <a name="NtA39"
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a><i>Take away Idleness, and you break
  </i>Cupids<i> Bow</i>: And I may say, with more then <i>Poetical
  Authority</i>, Take away Idleness, and you break the Devils Bow; for
  Idleness is the Bow out of which the Devil shoots the fiery Darts of his
  Temptations at us. And if, after all these Means used, you cannot <!--
  Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>contain
  your selves within the bounds of Chastity, then</p>

  <p>7. Enter the sacred Bonds of <i>Matrimony</i>: 'Tis far better thou
  shouldest marry then burn. Take St. <i>Pauls</i> counsel, who, <a
  name="NtA40" href="#Nt40"><sup>[40]</sup></a><i>to avoid fornication</i>,
  bids <i>every man have his own Wife, and every woman have her own
  Husband</i>. And though I cannot but esteem a single life and holy
  Cælibate (which was consecrated by the holy <i>Jesus</i> in his proper
  person) to be an excellent Virtue; yet since every one hath not that gift
  of continence which our Saviour had, and God hath instituted Matrimony as
  an Ordinance, and the holy <i>Jesus</i> hallowed it and made it
  honourable with the expence of the first Miracle (we read) he ever
  performed on Earth, and made it more sublimate by making it a
  Representation of the Union betwixt Him and his Spouse the Church; it is
  a thing highly commendable in it self, and to be made use of as a great
  Preservative against inordinacies in our Affections and unruly Passions:
  And a Learned Author puts it in the Catalogue of such <i>Arts</i> <a
  name="NtA41" href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a><i>without which a man
  cannot live well and <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>happily</i>; and says, "That although to
  live a single life is not totally repugnant to Humane Nature, yet it is
  repugnant to the Nature of most Men; Because a single life and cælibate
  are onely fitted for the most excellent Minds, and such as are refined
  from the dross of impure concupiscence." And another Author brings in
  <i>Romulus</i> speaking to his neighbouring Nations, <a name="NtA42"
  href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a><i>That they would not grudge to mix
  themselves together in a joynt Allyance and Consanguinity</i>. And though
  the <i>Roman</i> State seemed to countenance a single life, because they
  afforded Dignities to certain Vestal Virgins, yet the number of those
  Vestals was but small; and then the Dignities and Priviledges which they
  had were no other but that they were made equal in State to married
  Wives; they were preferred before all that lived unmarried, but not
  before married persons.</p>

  <p>But whilest I am speaking of this Order of Vestal Nuns, I cannot but
  endeavour to excite in you an abhorrency of those destructive Nunneries
  into which the Papists cast their Virgins in their <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>infancy, and before they
  come to maturity of years, or are (which they can never be) able to judge
  of the strength of their own continency. Into what Stews have these
  Nunneries been frequently converted, by reason of restraining those from
  the sacred Ligament of Marriage who have not so absolute a command over
  themselves as to abstain from unlawful carnality? How is that sacred
  Fire, which among the <i>Romans</i> of old was preserved by their Vestal
  Virgins, by these changed into <i>Flames of Lust</i>, which all their
  <i>Holy-water</i> will never allay or extinguish? Oh! that these sottish
  abusers of the Holy Ordinance of God called Marriage would but call to
  minde how the blessed and immaculate Virgin (our Saviours Mother) was
  betrothed to <i>Joseph</i>, lest honourable Marriage might be disreputed,
  and seem inglorious, by a positive rejection from any participation of
  that transcendent honour! I could heartily wish that these our
  <i>Romanists</i> would but imitate the brave example of the old
  <i>Romans</i>, who thought none eligible to be <i>Jupiters</i> Priests
  but such as were <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>Married; and (as <i>Tacitus</i> and
  <i>Suetonius</i> tell us) set a Fine upon their heads who refused to be
  united in the holy Bonds of Matrimony. It was out of respect to this,
  that the Emperour <i>Augustus</i> sent for <i>Germanicus</i> his
  Children, and hugging and caressing them in his Royal breast, signified
  by his countenance, and other signes of his hand, that others ought to
  imitate <i>Germanicus</i> in marrying with joy and alacrity.</p>

  <p>And thus you see I have asserted and maintained the laudable
  Priviledge and Ordination of Marriage; and now cannot but be convinced
  that you think, in this my last <i>Recipe</i> of Marriage I have
  prescribed you pleasanter Physick then in any of the former: If therefore
  you cannot obtain a cure from them, you may from this joyned to them.
  <i>Suetonius</i> tells us, that <i>Galba</i> selected a Jewel to
  beautifie and adorn the Goddess <i>Fortune</i>; which (on the sudden) as
  if it deserved a more sacred Deity, he dedicated to <i>Venus</i>. But I
  hope, that we, after we have selected those Pearls of price our Souls for
  Gods service, shall not <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>dedicate them to <i>Venus</i> and our
  sensual appetites; for we are most certainly informed by the Text,
  <i>That the end thereof is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged
  sword</i>.</p>
